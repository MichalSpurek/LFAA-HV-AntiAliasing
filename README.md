# LFAA-HV-AntiAliasing
A new method for smoothing aliasing in VR games.
I developed this new anti-aliasing method in hopes that it might inspire other developers to improve and implement it in VR.
For more information on how the method works, see the Presentation file, or you can also look directly at the code created in python.
